# Aggregate functions

Functions include: **COUNT, GROUP BY, MAX and MIN, SUM, AVG**

## 1. Count

<pre>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_lname, author_fname) FROM books;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books WHERE title LIKE '%the%';</pre>

## 2. Group By

<pre>SELECT author_lname, title FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
SELECT author_lname, 
    COUNT(*) FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;
SELECT CONCAT(COUNT(*), " books released in ", released_year) AS count FROM books
    GROUP BY released_year;</pre>;

## 3. Min and Max

<pre>SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books;
SELECT MAX(pages), title FROM books; # this is not going to work </pre>

## 4. Subqueries

<pre>## I want the title of the longest book?
## one way:
SELECT title FROM books WHERE pages = (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);
## OR
SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY pages LIMIT 1;</pre>

## 5. Min/Max and group by

<pre>SELECT CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname), MIN(released_year) FROM books 
    GROUP BY CONCAT(author_fname, author_lname);

SELECT
  CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,
  MAX(pages) AS 'longest book'
FROM books
GROUP BY author_lname,
         author_fname;</pre>

## 6. Sum

<pre>## Sum all pages each author has written
SELECT 
    CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,
    SUM(pages) FROM books GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname;</pre>

## 7. AVG

<pre>## Calculate the average stock quantity for books released in the same year
SELECT released_year, AVG(stock_quantity) FROM books GROUP BY released_year;</pre>

## Challenge

<pre>## Print the number of books in the database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books;
## Print out how many books were released in each year
SELECT COUNT(*), released_year FROM books GROUP BY released_year;
## Print out the total number of books in stock
SELECT SUM(stock_quantity) FROM books;
## Find the average released_year for each author
SELECT 
    CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,
    AVG(released_year) AS year
FROM books GROUP BY author_fname, author_lname;
## Find the full name of the author who wrote the longest book
SELECT
    CONCAT(author_fname, ' ', author_lname) AS author,
    pages
FROM books WHERE pages = (SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);
## Final one
SELECT
    released_year as year,
    COUNT(*) as "book #",
    AVG(pages) as "avg pages"
FROM books GROUP BY released_year;</pre>
