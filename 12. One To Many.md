## One to Many relationships:
- E.g., Books and review:
  - One book can have many reviews

<pre>CREATE TABLE customers(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    last_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
CREATE TABLE orders(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(8,2),
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) 
      REFERENCES customers(id)
      ON DELETE CASCADE
);
-- Inserting some customers and orders

INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email) 
VALUES ('Boy', 'George', 'george@gmail.com'),
       ('George', 'Michael', 'gm@gmail.com'),
       ('David', 'Bowie', 'david@gmail.com'),
       ('Blue', 'Steele', 'blue@gmail.com'),
       ('Bette', 'Davis', 'bette@aol.com');
       
INSERT INTO orders (order_date, amount, customer_id)
VALUES ('2016/02/10', 99.99, 1),
       ('2017/11/11', 35.50, 1),

       ('1999/04/11', 450.25, 5);
       
-- This INSERT fails because of our fk constraint.  No user with id: 98

INSERT INTO orders (order_date, amount, customer_id)

## CODE: Cross Joins
<pre>
-- Finding Orders Placed By George: 2 Step Process

SELECT id FROM customers WHERE last_name='George';
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1;
-- Finding Orders Placed By George: Using a subquery

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id =
    (
        SELECT id FROM customers
        WHERE last_name='George'
    );

-- Cross Join Craziness

SELECT * FROM customers, orders; </pre>

## Code: Inner Joins
<pre>
-- IMPLICIT INNER JOIN

SELECT * 
FROM customers, orders 
WHERE customers.id = orders.customer_id;
    
-- EXPLICIT INNER JOINS

SELECT * 
FROM customers
JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- ARBITRARY JOIN - meaningless, but still possible 

SELECT * FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.id;
</pre>

## Code: Left Joins
<pre>
SELECT 
    first_name, 
    last_name,
    IFNULL(SUM(amount), 0) AS total_spent
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.id
ORDER BY total_spent;
</pre>

## Code: right Joins
<pre>
SELECT 
    IFNULL(first_name,'MISSING') AS first, 
    IFNULL(last_name,'USER') as last, 
    order_date, 
    amount, 
    SUM(amount)
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
    ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name;
</pre>
