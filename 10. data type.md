# Data types revisited

Topics include: **VARCHAR and CHAR, DECIMAL, FLOAT and DOUBLE, DATE, TIME, and DATETIME, Functions and formatting syntax about time, math related to DATE, TIMESTAMP**

## 0. Preparation

USE data_type;

## 1. Difference between VARCHAR and CHAR

CHAR has a fixed length e.g., Char(3) -> Only 3 Characters Allowed
CHAR is faster for fixed length text e.g., State Abbreviations: CA, NY

## 2. Decimal

DECIMAL(5, 2); "5" -> Total Number Of Digits, "2" -> Digits After Decimal e.g., 999.99
<pre>CREATE TABLE prices(price DECIMAL(5,2));
INSERT INTO prices(price) VALUES(7); # 7.00
INSERT INTO prices(price) VALUES(7987654); # 999.99
INSERT INTO prices(price) VALUES(298.9999); # 299.00</pre>

## 3. FLOAT and DOUBLE

Compared to DECIMAL, Store larger numbers using less space, It comes at the cost of precision
| Data Type  | Memory Needed | Precision Issues |
| ---------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| FLOAT      | 4 Bytes	     |~7 digits         |
| DOUBLE     | 8 Bytes	     | ~15 digits       |

<pre>CREATE TABLE thingies (price FLOAT);
INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (88.45); # 88.45
INSERT INTO thingies(price) VALUES (8877665544.45); # 8877670000</pre>

## 4. DATE TIME and DATETIME

**DATE**: Values With a Date But No Time 'YYYY-MM-DD' Format
**TIME**: Values With a Time But No Date 'HH:MM:SS' Format
**DATETIME**: Values With a Date AND Time 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' Format

<pre>CREATE TABLE people (name VARCHAR(100), birthdate DATE, birthtime TIME, birthdt DATETIME);

INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Padma', '1983-11-11', '10:07:35', '1983-11-11 10:07:35');
INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Larry', '1943-12-25', '04:10:42', '1943-12-25 04:10:42');

SELECT * FROM people;</pre>

## 5. Functions about time

**CURDATE()**: current date
**CURTIME()**: current time
**NOW()**: current datetime

<pre>INSERT INTO people (name, birthdate, birthtime, birthdt)
VALUES('Meredith', CURDATE(), CURTIME(), NOW());</pre>

## 6. Formatting datetime

<pre>SELECT name, birthdate, DAY(birthdate) FROM people; ## DAY(): which day
SELECT name, birthdate, DAYNAME(birthdate) FROM people; ## DAYNAME(): Sun to Sat
SELECT name, birthdate, DAYOFWEEK(birthdate) FROM people; ## DAYOFWEEK(): 1-7
SELECT name, birthdate, DAYOFYEAR(birthdate) FROM people; ## DAYOFYEAR(): 1-365
SELECT name, birthdt, DAYOFYEAR(birthdt) FROM people;</pre>
6.1 **MONTH(), MONTHNAME(), HOUR(), MINUTE()**
<pre>SELECT name, birthdt, MONTH(birthdt) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthdt, MONTHNAME(birthdt) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthtime, HOUR(birthtime) FROM people;
SELECT name, birthtime, MINUTE(birthtime) FROM people;
SELECT CONCAT(MONTHNAME(birthdate), ' ', DAY(birthdate), ' ', YEAR(birthdate)) FROM people;</pre>
6.2 **Formatting**
<pre>SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, 'Was born on a %W') FROM people; # DAYNAME
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y') FROM people; # month/day/year
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(birthdt, '%m/%d/%Y at %h:%i') FROM people; # hour:minute</pre>

## 7. Date Math

<pre>SELECT name, birthdate, DATEDIFF(NOW(), birthdate) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 1 MONTH) FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, DATE_ADD(birthdt, INTERVAL 3 QUARTER) FROM people;

SELECT birthdt, birthdt - INTERVAL 5 MONTH FROM people;
SELECT birthdt, birthdt + INTERVAL 15 MONTH + INTERVAL 10 HOUR FROM people;</pre>

## 8. Timestamp

What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?
They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range, TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space. TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created or updated.

<pre>CREATE TABLE comments (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES('lol what a funny article');
INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES('I found this offensive'); 
INSERT INTO comments (content) VALUES('Ifasfsadfsadfsad');
SELECT * FROM comments ORDER BY created_at DESC;
 
CREATE TABLE comments2 (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
INSERT INTO comments2 (content) VALUES('dasdasdasd');
INSERT INTO comments2 (content) VALUES('lololololo');
INSERT INTO comments2 (content) VALUES('I LIKE CATS AND DOGS');
 
UPDATE comments2 SET content='THIS IS NOT GIBBERISH' WHERE content='dasdasdasd';
 
SELECT * FROM comments2; 
SELECT * FROM comments2 ORDER BY changed_at;

# same
CREATE TABLE comments2 (
    content VARCHAR(100),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() ON UPDATE NOW()
);</pre>

## Challenge

<pre>##Print Out The Current Time
SELECT CURTIME();
## Print Out The Current Date (but not time)
SELECT CURDATE();
## Print Out The Current Day Of The Week
SELECT DAYOFWEEK(NOW());
## Print Out The Current Day Of The Week (The Day Name)
SELECT DAYNAME(NOW());
## Print out the current day and time using this format: mm/dd/yyyy
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%m/%d/%Y');
## Print out the current day and time using this format: January 2nd at 3:15
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%W %D at %h:%i');
## Create a tweets table that stores: The Tweet content, A Username, Time it was created
CREATE TABLE tweets (content VARCHAR(100),
                   username VARCHAR(100),
                   created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAUlT now());</pre>
